Rocky's Relay Roar

On a sunny afternoon at the Woodland Track & Field Stadium, the annual Interspecies Relay Championship was underway. Teams from all corners of the forest had gathered, but the crowd's favorite was the Antelope Team—not actual antelopes, but a group of lightning-fast ants known for their unmatched teamwork.

Leading the charge was Ant #22, mid-stride, his eyes locked on his teammate, Ant #10, ready for the baton handoff. Their legs moved in perfect unison, their antennae bouncing with focus and determination. Behind them, Ant #32 and Ant #07 had already passed the baton with precision, cheering as the next leg of the race unfolded.

On the sidelines, Rocky the raccoon—coach, mentor, and number-one fan—watched with his heart pounding in excitement. His paws were raised, mouth wide open in a joyous cheer. "Go, go, GO!" he hollered, tail twitching with anticipation. He had trained these ants not just in speed but in spirit. "Pass it smooth, Anty! Just like we practiced!"

The baton moved seamlessly from one tiny hand to another, glinting in the sunlight like a blue streak of victory. With the handoff complete, Ant #10 exploded into motion, legs blurring as he darted down the track. Rocky could barely contain himself. He jumped, he clapped, he nearly rolled into a somersault.

The crowd roared. Birds chirped wildly in the trees, squirrels waved leafy pom-poms, and even the turtles peeked from their shells to watch. This wasn't just a race—it was a moment of unity, of effort, of a raccoon's belief in the tiny legs of his six-legged friends.

And whether they won gold or not, Rocky knew one thing for sure: this team had already sprinted straight into the heart of the forest.
